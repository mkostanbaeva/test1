# API
For work, you can use the following handle:

| Handle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [upload](#upload) | Is used to upload a data. |
| [get](#get) | Is used for reading a data.  |
| [downloadinfo](#downloadinfo) |  |
| [ping and stat](#ping-and-stat) | Lets you know about the operability proxy. |
| [stat_log and stat-log](#stat_log-and-stat-log) |  |
| [cache](#cache) | Shows the information received from the proxy mastermind and cashing in themselves. |
| [cache-update](#cache-update) | Makes proxy to immediately update information from mastermind, without waiting for the timeout. |

##hosts
###Production
The balancer open out for reading operation (the get handle only) - `storage.mds.yandex.net:80`.<br/>
The internal balancer for reading operation (the get handle only) - `storage-int.mds.yandex.net:80`.<br/>
The internal balancer for writing operation (the upload, delete, downloadinfo handle) - `storage-int.mds.yandex.net:12000`.

###Testing
The host for reading operation (the get handle only) - `storage.mdst.yandex.net:80`.<br/>
The host for writing operation (the upload, delete, downloadinfo handle) - `storage-int.mdst.yandex.net:12000`.

##upload 
###Description
Handle is used to upload a data. Used as follows - *hostname:port/upload-$namespace/$filename* and a data will be transmist by post. Where are: 
* *$namespace* - the name of your namespase,
* *$filename* -  name of the key for your data.
When you specify the namespace will be issued Authorization header, which should not forget to indicate -
[more here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). <br/>
The proxy has no restrictions on the size of upload files (it uploads by pieces, as they come to the socket).

Additional arguments (transmitted by GET):
* `offset` - an offset with which data should be written, you can use to overwrite the piece of file;
* `embed` or `embed_timestamp` and `timestamp` - the `embed` flag is used to store meta-information together with a data; from meta-information supported now only `timestamp`.

###HTTP response codes
200 - Ok (response will be similar to that in Example), <br/>
400 - the request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax, <br/>
401 - forgot to specify a title for the authorization <br/>
507 - in your namespaces is not enough space for writing this size <br/>
5xx - the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request, we already know about it and fix it.

###Example
Request: 
```
curl -H "Authorization: Basic ZGVmYXVsdDoxMjM=" "http://storage-int.mds.yandex.net:12000/upload-default/file1" -d "data"
```
Answer:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<post obj="default.file1" id="81d8ba78474fa835aab93150230020bf94d23fc7e4c5390f6f65951210d1f254dad1a27643bd84f087ed39125b1f54a988e5b7e2f5f2d18b0218c00666dd35d1" groups="3" size="4" key="221/file1">
<complete addr="141.8.145.55:1032" path="/srv/storage/8/data-0.0" group="223" status="0"/>
<complete addr="141.8.145.116:1032" path="/srv/storage/8/data-0.0" group="221" status="0"/>
<complete addr="141.8.145.119:1029" path="/srv/storage/5/data-0.0" group="225" status="0"/>
<written>3</written>
</post>
```
Should pay attention to:
* at the `post` tag attribute `key="221/file1"` - the key with which you can work with written data (read and delete).  The key will be equal $filename when written in namespace with a static group. Generally, the key is made so: /$group/$ filename, where $group - any of the groups in which the data were written;
* at the `post` tag attribute `obj` - generated key for the data $namespace.$filename);
* at the `post` tag attribute `id` - sha512(obj) - elliptics saved a data under this key;
* at the `post` tag attribute `groups` - a number of groups in which have tried to write;
* at the `post` tag attribute `size`-  a data size;
* at the `complete` tag attribute `addr` - an address of the node where the data were written;
* at the `complete` tag attribute `path` - a path to the data;
* at the `complete` tag attribute `group` - a group number (can be used as part of the key to read/delete operations);
* at the `complete` tag attribute `status` - a status of the operation (0 - ok);
* the `written` tag - a number of groups that succeeded to write.

##get
###Description 
Handle is used for reading a data. Used as follows - *hostname:port/get-$namespace/$group/$filename*, where is *$group/$filename* is value from `key` attribute `post` tag in answer from write operation. For namespace with a static group - *hostname:port/get-$namespace/$filename*.

Additional arguments (transmitted by GET):
* `offset` - an offset with which data should be reading;
* `size` - a size of the data chunk to be read;
* `embed` and `embed_timestamp` - flag is used to indicate that the data was written with the meta-information (now is a legacy -  proxy may determine this fact for all new written data).

###HTTP response codes
200 - Ok, <br/>
404 - no data was found for this key, <br/>
5xx - the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request, we already know about it and fix it.

###Example
Request: 
```
curl "http://storage.mds.yandex.net:80/get-default/221/file1"
```

```
data
```
In a response are coming your data. 

##delete
###Description 
Handle is used for deleting a data. Used as follows - *hostname:port/delete-$namespace/$group/$filename*, where is  *$group/$filename* is value from `key` attribute `post` tag in answer from write operation. When you specify the namespace will be issued Authorization header, which should not forget to indicate -
